Project was done as an HTML and CSS excercise. No Javascript was used, as the primary focus was to better familiarize myself with how large complex website are structured and styled, not how they function.

Decided to use the LESS preprocessor instead of plain CSS in order to get some experience. Generally similar, but made sure to use variables which make consistent colour themes easier to implement.

Happy with how I implemented the preview-on-hover feature for the recommended videos. Done by having a static image acting as the thumbnail sitting on top the animated .webp. Static image becomes transparent when hovered over, revealing the animated .webp underneath as a preview. Method is not perfect however, as .webp animations are constantly playing in the background.

Harder project than expected, which forced me to delve into certain CSS concepts I had been using somewhat thoughtlessley in the past.
